	<h1>Welcome to my Final Project.</h1>
	<p>In this project, I will be doing basic registration to
	demonstrate cookies, and serving different versions of a page to a
	user depending on whether they are an admin or a user.</p><br>
	<p>If they are an admin, they will:</p>
	<div class="center">
	<ul>
		<li>Have access to previously registered users, whose values are stored in an array based on what number they are.</li>
		<li>Be able to "ban" or delete those users</li>
		<li>Be able to manipulate the user's username and password</li>
		<li>Be able to do whatever a user is able to do</li>
	</ul>
	</div>
	<p>If they are a user, they will:</p>
	<div class="center">
	<ul>
		<li>Be able to deposit money, which adds it to their
		total balance</li>
		<li>Be able to withdraw money, which subtracts it
		from their total balance</li>
	</ul>
	</div>
	<p>Click <a href="p1.html">here</a> to start the registration process.</p>
